# Astropy Search Demo

This repository is a demonstration of a documentation search service for the [Astropy Project](https://www.astropy.org).
The site itself is built around [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com).
Records for the Algolia database are curated and formatted by the [astropy-librarian](https://github.com/jonathansick/astropy-librarian) app.
Ultimately this search functionality will be built into the [learn.astropy.org](https://learn.astropy.org) site; in the meantime this stripped-down site lets us explore the interplay between front-end search experience and back-end data preparation.
